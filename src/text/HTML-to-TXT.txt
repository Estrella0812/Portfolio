Designed to transform HTML documents into readable and structured text format. 
I utilized beautiful Soup library in Python to parse and extract the desired HTML elements saving the raw text into a file.
JavaScript then took over to further enhance the text's clarity and readability.
Batch script was employed to systematically run both the Python and JavaScript components in sequence.
